# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - List commonly used libraries for Data Science
# - Demonstrate simple arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
#     
# 1. Python
# 2. SQL
# 3. R

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. NumPy
# 3. Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[2]:


#This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes/60
hours
